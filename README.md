# Pattern-Recognition-Course-Final-Project-on-Missing-Data
__Project Description__

This repository focuses on understanding the different methods for dealing with missing data in pattern recognition. We will explore two main approaches: the imputation-based approach and the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm-based approach.

__Approaches to Missing Data__

__1. Imputation-Based Approach__  
The imputation-based approach involves assigning replacement values to missing, invalid, or inconsistent data. We will examine five imputation methods:  
•	Imputation by a Single Value: Using a default value, mean, or median to replace missing values.  
•	Imputation by the Center of the Group: Replacing missing values with the central value of a predefined group.  
•	Imputation from the K Nearest Neighbors: Using values from the k nearest neighbors to estimate the missing values.  
•	Imputation by a Partial Mean: Replacing missing values with the mean calculated from available partial data.  
•	Imputation by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Using SVD to estimate and replace missing values based on underlying patterns in the data.  

2. EM Algorithm-Based Approach
The EM algorithm approach completes a series of missing data based on the maximum likelihood estimation of all the data. This approach iterates between estimating the missing data (E-step) and optimizing the parameters (M-step) to converge to the most likely values.
Project Tasks
For each method and approach, we will provide the following:
1.	Principle: A detailed explanation of the underlying principle of the method.
2.	Mathematical Model: The mathematical formulation and model used in the method.
3.	Relevant Example: An example that illustrates how the method works in practice.
4.	Implementation Example in Python: A Python code snippet that demonstrates the method's implementation.
Example Structure
Imputation by a Single Value
•	Principle: We will describe how default values, means, or medians are used to replace missing data.
•	Mathematical Model: We will provide the formulae for calculating mean and median.
•	Relevant Example: We will illustrate with a dataset where missing values are replaced by the mean.
•	Implementation Example in Python
EM Algorithm-Based Approach
•	Principle: We will explain the iterative process of estimating missing values and optimizing parameters.
•	Mathematical Model: We will detail the E-step and M-step equations.
•	Relevant Example: We will show an example dataset where the EM algorithm is applied to estimate missing values.
•	Implementation Example in Python
